# Rollercoaster-Mini-Project


Create a small program that decides whether a person is allowed to ride a rollercoaster based on their weight. If a person weighs more than 120 kg they cannot ride. If they weigh 120 kg or less they can ride.
Requirements
Request the user’s weight (in kilograms) as input.
Treat the input as a number (float or int).
If the weight is greater than 120, print a message that they cannot ride.
If the weight is 120 or less, print a message that they can ride.
